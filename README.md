# Java Design Guide
This project contains an ordered list of resources that I have collected over time that aim to help Java developers achieve higher code quality through the use of various techniques. These are all my personal opinions so your opinion may vary from mine. 

This guide is split into separate chapters with each chapter containing information regarding a certain development cycle.

## Project planning
To create a successful project first think about what you actually want to achieve. If you were to just start programming stuff  you will probably write low quality code that does not function the way you intended it to be.

[Click here](planning.md) to read about some techniques that I use before starting to type code.

## Developing
When you start coding you will want to maintain high code quality throughout your project. The linked page below contains some resources on how to write quality code.

[Click here](development.md) to read about techniques and standards I use to maintain high quality code.

## Documentation
Documentation is an import part of your code. If you look back at your code after a couple of months or let another developer take a look at your code you want to instantly understand it by reading the documentation.

[Click here](documentation.md) to read about methods I use to write effective code documentation.
